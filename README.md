# Vinder ğŸ”¥ğŸ¥¦

Vinder wants to simplify the process of finding vegan and vegetarian restaurants in Los Angeles.

Vinder is hosted on Firebase at https://vinder-7b6c9.web.app/

The number of vegans and vegetarians has been steadily on the rise for years. We wanted to create an application that would help this growing group and make it easy for them to find a place to eat in LA!

Users of our app can choose from various regions in LA to eat, including Downtown, Manhattan Beach, and near Loyola Marymount University.

Users can also log in to save their favorites and a wishlist of restaurants to visit in the future.
